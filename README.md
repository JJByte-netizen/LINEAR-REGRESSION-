# LINEAR-REGRESSION-
gistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, where the target variable is dichotomous (e.g., 0 and 1). To prepare data for logistic regression, preprocessing steps like normalizing, binning, and scrubbing are often applied. Hereâ€™s how these steps can be implemented:

1. Normalizing
Normalization scales numerical features to a specific range (commonly [0, 1] or [-1, 1]). This ensures that all features contribute equally to the model, especially when they have different units or scales.

Why normalize? Logistic regression is sensitive to feature scaling, as coefficients are influenced by the magnitude of the input variables.

How to normalize? Use techniques like Min-Max Scaling or Z-score Standardization:

Min-Max Scaling: X_{norm} = \frac{X - X_{\text{min}}}{X

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'Feature1': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
    'Feature2': [1.2, 2.4, 3.1, 4.8, 5.5],
    'Target': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Splitting features and target
X = df[['Feature1', 'Feature2']]
y = df['Target']

# Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Splitting data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_normalized, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", conf_matrix)

This code demonstrates normalization using Min-Max Scaling and implements a logistic regression model. It splits the dataset, trains the model, and evaluates it using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

Let me know if you'd like to add binning or scrubbing steps!
